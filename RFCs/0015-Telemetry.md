# 0015 Telemetry

## Summary
This document outlines the telemetry data points to be collected by vstest platform along with the expectations from any vstest consuming platform, wanting to use these telemetry data points for their own needs.

## Overview
Going forward vstest platform will enable collection of rich telemetry data points to helps us and any vstest consuming platform in making the right choices to improve end user experience. The telemetry data points we plan to collect in vstest, doesn't contain any information that can be used to identify an individual e.g. name, email, username etc. More details on telemetry data points below.

## Data Points
Following telemetry data points will be collected by vstest and also enabled for collection by any vstest consuming platform:
* Size of tests (e.g. numberOfTestsSources, numberOfTestsRun, duration etc.)
* Configuration of tests (e.g. parallelExecution, dataCollectorUsed, adapterVersion etc.)
* Composition of tests (e.g. targetOS, targetPlatform, targetFramework etc.)
* Features used (e.g. codeCoverage, settings etc.)
* Time (time of operation)
* Source of invocation (vstest consuming platform)
For more details please refer to the **Detailed List of Data Points** section at the end

## Conceptual Flow
![alt text](https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/master/RFCs/Images/vstest.telemetry.png) 

## Scope
* vstest and vstest.console.exe will emit telemetry data points that any vstest consuming platform can listen to
* vstest consuming platform needs to provide the following information to the vstest
  * indicator of user consent
  * source of invocation
* Consuming platform needs to create a listener that can collect the data points and route it to their respective telemetry backend
* No PII or EUII data will be collected by vstest
* vstest will respect the user consent flowing in from the consuming platform

## User Consent [Opt-In, Opt-Out]
Any vstest consuming platform can collect the telemetry events and redirect to the backend of their choice, however it is the responsibility of the consuming platform to
* Enable opt-in | opt-out experience for their users
* Ensure compliance (data, security, privacy etc.)
