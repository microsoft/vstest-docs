# Welcome to **VS TEST PLATFORM**

VS Test Platform helps you author and execute tests for .NET, Javascript,
Python, Node etc.. Thanks to the community of test adapters, you can author
tests in any test framework of your choice, be it NUnit, XUnit, MSTest for .NET
or Jasmine, QUnit for JS and so on.

All of that on any Linux, Mac or Windows machine! We promise it will take a few
minutes and an editor to [get started](#).
